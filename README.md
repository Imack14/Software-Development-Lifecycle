Sprint Review and Retrospective – Portfolio Submission
Portfolio Artifact Reflection
Throughout this project I learned a lot about how important it is to really understand user needs and build them directly into the program. Creating user stories made it easier to break down what users actually wanted into clear actionable tasks. Instead of guessing what a user might want, user stories gave us real examples so we could design and prioritize work that had direct value. By writing out acceptance criteria and talking through each story it was a lot easier to stay aligned with the client’s goals. That structure helped the team avoid misunderstandings and made development faster and smoother.

When I start developing programs I usually break things down step by step but Agile taught me to focus even more on small frequent deliveries and continuous feedback. I hope to carry forward a lot of the Agile practices we used especially Sprint Planning, Daily Standups, and Retrospectives. Having regular short meetings kept everyone connected without getting bogged down and the retrospective sessions helped us constantly improve. I would also want to use tools like Jira and Trello again to visualize the work and help the whole team stay focused and flexible.
Being a good team member in software development is not just about doing your piece of the project, it is about staying communicative, flexible, and collaborative. One big thing I learned is that being open in daily standups, quickly raising blockers, and offering help to others goes a long way in keeping momentum. Having a positive attitude and making space for feedback during retrospectives made a huge difference for our team culture too. Good development teams do not just build software, they build trust along the way.

Overall this project reinforced that clear communication, active collaboration, and flexibility to change are what really drive success in software development teams.
